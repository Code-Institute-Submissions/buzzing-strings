### Project Testing

Testing is a very important tool and has a lot of benefits in terms of achieving  
a successfull final effect. Having testing in my project helped to find the 
errors I made while building the website. I was aware that I had to come up with a simple
but effective testing plan. I decided that each line of my code had to be carefully 
scrutinised to make sure all was working properly. Using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) 
I created the wireframes which allowed me deliver a clear outcome by conducting a number of 
tests using website selected features. I also used the popular validation tools to make sure 
the created content had no major defects: 

1. [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - to validate HTML

2. [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - to validate CSS

3. [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) - to validate Python code

4. [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - to validate JavaScript/jQuery
