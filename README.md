### Acknowledgements
This project would not be completed without a great support of my family and mentor [Simen Daehlin](https://github.com/Eventyret).
Their constructive advice delivered valid and well-reasoned opinions. It involved both positive and negative comments which helped 
me to see my project from a different perspective and amend the content to achieve the ultimate goal, a user-friendly and
interesting website. 

Also, I would like to thank my fellow [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) students and tutors who always been there for me, 
offering a friendly advice when I was having problems with sorting things out. Last but not least [Slack](https://slack.com/signin#/signin) 
community which I found extremely helpful in resolving code-related issues.
